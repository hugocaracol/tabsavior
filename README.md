Tab savior
==========

This is a Chrome Extension I created based on a real problem I usually have. When I need to restart my system or the browser, for whatever reason, all the open tabs (with articles to read) are lost.

This is intended to be as simple as possible. You can save tabs or load tabs from a previous save action. It saves tabs from all chrome instances.

Enjoy!
